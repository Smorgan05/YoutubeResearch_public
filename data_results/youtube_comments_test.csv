@hamiltonaraujoleite4049,"I don&#39;t think it can be emphasized enough how profoundly funny it is that J.K. Rowling continues to be an unbearable feminist on most current topics, but the fact that she disagrees with the specific point of the crazies who think that a few aesthetic changes allow them to claim they&#39;ve changed gender was enough for her to be excommunicated from modern progressive politics.",694,2024-11-23T00:40:15Z

Shad was still sitting in a stiff wooden throne in an empty room with a fake frame showing Power Point illustrations.

@daywither927,"Luke vs Harry? That should be a relatively easy win for Luke. As far as I can recall, wizards are just normal humans with the speed of humans, which automatically gives any Jedi the advantage of being faster, and you can nearly nullify a wizard by taking away his wand, which a Jedi can do literally with his mind. Besides that, even the normal human wizards can dodge at least certain spells, so a Jedi should be able to avoid a good chunk of what gets thrown at him. I could also analyze how precisely you use the magic or the force, but no need to do such complicated stuff: the Jedi would disarm the wizard before he could react, and then do whatever he would do to a normal human while the wizard is busy trying to focus on casting a spell without a wand.",7,2024-11-23T02:46:46Z

@markgregorygacosta531,"Cobra Kai season 2 reminds of how Studio Mappa divided Attack on Titan season 4 to parts 1,2,3. No complaints though,  I love how Cobra Kai is going into this direction, because the story is really good. BTW, that brawl scene in the final episode is the Marineford (One Piece) version of Cobra Kai.<br>I&#39;m also glad you guys brought up One piece as a point of comparisons for making live actions. I can say that OPLA is pretty great because it&#39;s like the &#39;believable&#39; &#39;serious&#39; or realistic version. <br>One piece (specially in the early 2000s) has goofy art styles and animation comparable to Western shows, and this is what stopped most people from starting the series. But  what really makes this show thrive up to now with a huge loyal fan base are the brilliant characterization, amazing story, plot twists, mysterious characters, fan theories, foreshadowing, power system, and even attention to details. <br>This is why it has over a thousand episodes now, and we even think it&#39;s not enough because there&#39;s still a lot to be told. <br>But honestly right now the current anime actually has amazing animation. <br>Can&#39;t wait for you guys to get to Egghead island arc and watch Garp battle tremendously strong Blackbeard pirate crew members.",7,2024-11-23T00:34:30Z

@ChancellorOtomovonBismarck,"I&#39;m glad women get to have their own movies again. There haven&#39;t been all that many in the last 10 years. A lot of male properties have been &quot;re-tooled&quot; for female audiences and ruined for both men and women, but even then stuff like John Wick, historical movies, Alien etc. still get made (aside from quality). But actual female movies are quite limited in the mainstream. Someone probably still makes hallmark trash.<br><br>Also sorry Gladiator 2 IS bad. The acting is bad, the villains are comedic caricatures and the story is a repeat.

The image of the gladiators and praetorian guard united carrying Maximus&#39; body out of the arena while Commodus is left alone dead on the ground was powerful. The sequel just makes a lot of what Maximus fought and died for pointless because Rome is in an even worst state. <br><br>Plus look at the cast you had in the original. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed...4 phenomenal actors. Now look at whose in the sequel!

North africans were in rome, moroccans, libyans, pre-contact with bantu egyptians, and they had their own appearance that was not even remotely similar to black people. I will finish off by citing the carthaginian explorer Hanno, a contemporary of the romans who first sailed round the lefthand side of africa and met Bantus. He thought they were man eating monkeys, that the jungles and man eating monkeys in bantu africa made all further exploration of sub saharan african coast a waste of time and too dangerous. No one sailed that way until vasco da gama 1700 (one thousand seven hundred) years later.

@elCorciu,"One thing about arcane season 2: this time they went really hardcore on the League of Legends lore and universe, basically was mostly for fans of the game. We as fans love it, we like all the mentions, the subplots and the hints/easter eggs.. it&#39;s like Christmas on every episode. <br>I know from outsiders could be overwhelming and we are hoping on a big payoff in act 3 that will explain everything that could now be seen as plot holes, but I agree it&#39;s maybe too fast paced and the passage of time is not a clear as it was in the first season (also because here we don&#39;t have the aging element).<br>Overall I think League of Legends as a whole may be overwhelming at this point, it&#39;s niche, it&#39;s become huge by this point and there&#39;s been multiple overhauls of the universe, they are still changing some lore currently, trying to intertwine 160+ characters is massive ordeal and they want to make a MMO so it kinda has to be done, but it&#39;s like going down a rabbit hole.<br>I dropped the game 2 years ago, but I was so invested I still follow the development and the competitive scene, so to me and my league friends it&#39;s chef&#39;s kiss, but I completely understand why regular people may not like season 2 as much right now.",0,2024-11-23T07:02:21Z

@DiegoSouto-fy9su,"If that Jaguar commercial had turned from those androgynous androids from a failed Bowie music video into Brosnan when they entered the car, that&#39;d be an awesome reversal of trends and an acknowledgment of what men&#39;s psyches like about cars. You enter as a zero but once you&#39;re in that tremendous machine, you&#39;ve graduated to not just a man, you&#39;re a god damn agent.",0,2024-11-23T03:21:26Z

@Nostromo2144,"No one ever said anything or in any way infringed upon their rights or identity as human beings. If they want to identify as whatever, more power to them - they are welcome to seek a mental health professional or not, don&#39;t really care, so long as they have the decency to do it in private. Which was absolutely fine for decades at least, until they started pushing their insanity on us, our entertainment and the world in general. Hell no!",0,2024-11-23T01:48:01Z
