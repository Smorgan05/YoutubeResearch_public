# YoutubeResearch
 
* This is a data science research project to analyze connections between youtube channels to identify communities of interest for reactionary influencers.  This effort is based on a youtube video I watched from Pillar of Garbage (https://www.youtube.com/@PillarofGarbage) where he identified a grifterverse of youtube personalities that amplify toxic content that is a followon from GamerGate in 2014 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign). These tactics follow an effort by breitbart to expand the altright pipeline (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right_pipeline) into different communities (video games, movies, comics, standup comedians, etc.)

  * The goal of this effort is to better understand these communities and gain more experience with AI generated code / data analysis.

* Here are the Youtube videos from Pillar of Garbage
  *  'Woke X-Men' and the Web of Grifter Media - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAg9zsBy7fo
  *  Across The Grifterverse - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnGpoFq9y5c
  *  Beyond the Grifterverse - https://youtu.be/leCND966O4E?list=PLsf-M5Ux6kmUHBlKZnCetVeOGJzphpLVX

* And here are the websites I used to identify additional channels
  *  https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthankrayt/comments/1evofak/a_list_of_reactionary_and_farright_yt_channels/
  *  https://datasociety.net/library/alternative-influence/
  *  https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/5807  

* Note: the youtube api documemntation
  *  https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos

* From that I took a look at reddit to identify a number of youtube channels and begin pulling data.  This is an ongoing effort.
  *  Note: Much of the code is AI generated from Microsoft CoPilot with analysis by ChatGPT
